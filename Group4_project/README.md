All needed code is located in "runme.ipynb" and the 
needed data is in the same folder, Group4_project.

Running ipynb, section by section, gives the results of 
the different questions in the project. For clarification, 
headers are used to show which question it is.

Hyperparameters (mu_prior, sigma_prior and beta_inv) are set 
in the beggining and are used for throughout the project 
up until Q9 where they are changed for that specific data set.
They are then changed again for Q10.

If one wants to try to shuffle the serie A data before doing ADF 
in Q5 - replace serie_A_data=serie_A_data with serie_A_data=serie_A_shuffle
